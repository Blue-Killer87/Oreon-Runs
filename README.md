# Oreon Runs

Modern application for orienteering.

This is a graduation work that focuses on creating a working mobile application to use for orienteering sport. The goal is to start small and create the first working prototype that will be useful for school purposes. Later in higher versions I will focus on wider use of this application, hopefully aiming for official use in this sport one day. 
As of the 31st March this work should get near the 10.0.0 version, which will be the first official full version of the app, which should contain stuff like QR scanning and creating, live map tracking, track creating, track saving a loading and much more.
